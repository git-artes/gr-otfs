# gr-otfs
A very simple implementation of OTFS (Orthogonal Time-Frequency Space) modulation in GNU Radio. 

Compatible with GNU Radio 3.8. I did this to illustrate the operation of OTFS for a seminar we taught in the telecom department. It's based on Chapter 4 of "Delay-Doppler Communications: Principles and Applications" by Yi Hong, Tharaj Thaj and Emanuele Viterbo, Academic Press, 2022.
